# KNN Euclidean Distance Classifier

This repository contains Python code for implementing a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier using Euclidean distance. The classifier is applied to a sample dataset, and the training and test errors are visualized for different values of K.

## Euclidean Distance Matrix

A 19x19 matrix representing Euclidean distances between samples.

## Class Labels

Class labels for samples: Class 1 (0) and Class 2 (1).

## Training and Test Sets

Training and test sets are defined with corresponding indices.

## KNN Classification

The code includes the implementation of the KNN classifier using Euclidean distance. The training and test errors are calculated for various values of K.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/KNN-Euclidean-Distance-Classifier.git
2. Run the Python script:
   python knn_classifier.py
3. Explore the visualization of training and test errors against different values of K.

## Dependencies
- numpy
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn
